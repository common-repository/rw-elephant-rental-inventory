The RW Elephant Rental Inventory Plugin enables event rental businesses to seamlessly display their collection on their own websites.


== Description ==

The RW Elephant Rental Inventory Plugin enables rental businesses to seamlessly display their collection on their own websites. Easily show your customers your Rental Items with the images, descriptions, tags, and all of the other important details youâ€™ve included in your RW Elephant account.


== Installation ==

= Important Information =
**Notes:**
* We always recommend creating a restorable backup of your website, theme and all other website resources before installing the RW Elephant Rental Inventory Plugin. To find out more about creating backups for your WordPress website you can refer to the WordPress documentation at - [https://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Backups](https://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Backups).
* Please uninstall and delete v1.5.1 prior to installing and activating the new v2.0 plugin. Before you do this, please refer to the previous point on creating a restorable backup of your website. Testing v2.0 of the plugin on a separate Staging or Development environment is highly recommended, and we strongly advise against testing a new plugin on your Live website.
* The "Inventory Gallery" can only be setup to display on a subpage, and unfortunately cannot be used on the homepage/front-page of the WordPress site.
* Users of the BoldGrid Plugin will be unfortunately be unable to use the Customized Templates functionality of the Plugin to make advanced customisations. This is unfortunately due to differences in how both Plugins make use of WordPress page templates. The plugin is however compatible for standard use.

Since this is an improved v2.0 of our original plugin and includes major changes, it is unfortunately incompatible with previous versions.

The plugin has been optimized for use with WordPress themes that include page-templates for displaying "Full-width" pages (pages that use the full width of the screen and generally don't have a sidebar).

The plugin will need to generate two pages within WordPress to function:

1. A page to display the "Inventory Gallery" (must be a WordPress subpage, and cannot be the site homepage/front-page).
1. A page to display the "Wishlist".

You can create both pages manually within the WordPress "Pages" menu before installing the plugin and call them anything of your choice, or allow the plugin to generate them automatically for you during the installation process (automatically generated pages will be named "Gallery" and "Wishlist").
